    /// Allows creation and management of a single member for a single binding within
    /// the IAM policy for an existing Yandex Organization Manager organization.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** Roles controlled by `yandex.OrganizationManagerOrganizationIamBinding`
    ///    should not be assigned using `yandex.OrganizationManagerOrganizationIamMember`.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** When you delete `yandex.OrganizationManagerOrganizationIamBinding` resource,
    ///    the roles can be deleted from other users within the organization as well. Be careful!
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Yandex = Pulumi.Yandex;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///         var editor = new Yandex.OrganizationManagerOrganizationIamMember("editor", new Yandex.OrganizationManagerOrganizationIamMemberArgs

    ///
