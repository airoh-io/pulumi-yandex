    /// Allows creation and management of a single member for a single binding within
    /// the IAM policy for an existing Yandex Resource Manager cloud.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** Roles controlled by `yandex.ResourcemanagerCloudIamBinding`
    ///    should not be assigned using `yandex.ResourcemanagerCloudIamMember`.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** When you delete `yandex.ResourcemanagerCloudIamBinding` resource,
    ///    the roles can be deleted from other users within the cloud as well. Be careful!
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Yandex = Pulumi.Yandex;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///         var department1 = Output.Create(Yandex.GetResourcemanagerCloud.InvokeAsync(new Yandex.GetResourcemanagerCloudArgs
    ///         {
    ///             Name = "Department 1",
    ///         }));
    ///         var admin = new Yandex.ResourcemanagerCloudIamMember("admin", new Yandex.ResourcemanagerCloudIamMemberArgs
    ///         {
    ///             CloudId = department1.Apply(department1 =&gt; department1.Id),
    ///             Member = "userAccount:user_id",

    ///         });
    ///     }
    ///

    /// ```

    ///
